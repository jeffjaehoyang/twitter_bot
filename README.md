# twitter_bot

<Twitter Bot>
Plan: 

1. Generate a repository of words --> use Python webs craping for accomplishing this.

2. With the generated repository of words, use Markov Chain to create a grammatically correct randomly-generated sentence.

3. Make a Twitter Bot with the sentence generating program we've already created with the Markov Chain - I'll need to make use of the Twitter API for this (API Keys, too).

4. After the above step we have a functional twitter bot, but it might be a good idea to put it onlnie for people to be able to see/interact with the bot

5. Scripting - for the webscraper (so we can grow the repository as time goes), and for the bot itself (to tweet something out there every day)
