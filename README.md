<Twitter Bot>
Explanation of this Twitter Bot - The "Three Word Philosopher": 

Step 1. 
Generate a repository of words by using Python's webscraping library, BeautifulSoup. The code I wrote scraped an e-book from the gutenberg project (for the wealth of words), and cleaned it up using Python's re libary. 

Step 2. 
With the cleaned up repository of words, split the long string of cleaned text into lists of words that can be used as the first word, and the ending word. 

Step 3. 
Generate a sentence using the lists of words made from step2 using Python's random library. 

Step 4. 
Interact with the Twitter API to tweet online! To make things a bit more interesting, I created a website that shows my Twitter Bot with an interface, and deployed it to Heroku. 

Here is the working link to the app deployed on Heroku: https://threewordthinker-api-heroku.herokuapp.com
